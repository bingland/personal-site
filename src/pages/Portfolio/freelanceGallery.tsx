          In my freelance career so far, I have worked primarily as a UX/UI designer and have come up with tons of 
          designs for a large amount of websites and applications that cover a large range of different industries 
          and types of applications, whether thatâ€™s a new site creation tool or even a new website for a professional 
          rodeo bullriding team. I have also had the opportunity to bring my designs to life by coding them myself using 
          frameworks like Svelte, Astro and Tailwind, as well as other frontend technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
